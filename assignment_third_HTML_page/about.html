      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Let me quickly introduce myself. I'm Jonnie, 37 years old and starting a front-end development course at Winc Academy. Previously I worked at various companies in ecommerce as Category Manager, Business Development Manager and Project Manager. Now it's time to do learn about the most interesting part of the world wide web, actually developing websites.</p>
      <p>I live together with my wife and two cats in Amsterdam and am currently renovating my apartment. My hobbies are going out for a fancy dinner and sports like cycling and football.</p>
